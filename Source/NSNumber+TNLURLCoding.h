/**
 `NSNumber(TNLURLCoding)` is a category on `NSNumber` to add helpers for encoding  support.
 TNL treats `NSNumber` as a first class object for encoding. The encoding of an `NSNumber` is based
 on the `TNLURLEncodableDictionaryOptionReplaceDictionariesWithDictionariesOfEncodableStrings`
 option being present or not.

 ## Custom encoding of numbers

 If a consumer wishes to encode a number in a different way the consumer can use a different object
 instead of an `NSNumber`.
 For convenience, `TNLBoolean` is provided so that the object can be encoded as `@"true"` or
 `@"false"` based on the `boolValue` of the object always, regardless of encoding format or options.

 Returns a `TNLBoolean` object that will encode as `@"true"` or `@"false"` based on the receiver's
 `boolValue`.

/**
 For most `NSNumber` instances, this is a faster way of getting the string value than `stringValue`
 or `descriptionWithLocale:`.
 Interally falls back to `descriptionWithLocale:` if it cannot convert (never encountered a case yet).

 Random sampling on 124,000 NSNumbers on 1 thread (via Xcode Simulator on 10-core 3GHz Xeon W)
 -[NSNumber stringValue] = 1.149726s
 -[NSNumber tnl_quickStringValue] = 0.775426s
 Pretty consistently achieves 33% speedup on average.
 Using `TNLURLEncodeDictionary` for converting a `TNLRequestConfiguration` into an identifier string
 (very regular within TNL) has more than 60% speedup.
